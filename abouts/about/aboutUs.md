<summary><b><font color=#c97d42>About</font></b></summary>

I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in Grade 10, and I've been coding for two years. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French and Spanish! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship. I decided to make a mod called <font color=purple>TOR-W</font> to help others understand and remember the roles better!<br>
I specialize in HTML, CSS, C# and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python.<br><br>
I am currently in ***three*** projects:<br>
1. The Website: To have any/all information about all of the projects and what most of the projects are about.<br>
2. TOR-W: To help people understand and remember the roles better & to make a pleasing experience.<br>
3. Modding Us: A game mainly Based off of Among Us, but supports custom-made mods & modded roles alone in the game.
