---

You can expect almost **ANYTHING** can be expected! From leaks, to the potential release of TOR-W v1.0.0!
There has been a few minor changes also to the roles and plans for the first release.

<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b> üîç What Has Changed?</b></p>

---

There has been a delay for the chat commands to release in v1.1.0, as I want to get the first release out ASAP. There was also a change in roles, there was mentioned that **Swooper** & **Medic** would have been added, but got scrapped due to certain reasons.
